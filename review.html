                     <p>&nbsp;Bizchic.com has done so much to boost my confidence in the workplace. I've always been a shy and have never liked being the center of attention, which might make you wonder why I chose such a socially invovled career! I really love finance, especially presenting financial reports, it's kind of my thing. Since finding bizchic.com, I have been taking its adive to heart with how I dress and present myself, and WOW I have become so much more confident, and don't mind being the center of attention as much. This sounds cheesy, but bizchic.com turned my life around.</p>

                     <p>&nbsp;So, I am a Finance Director for a pretty major tech company as well as a single mother. So as you could guess, time is tight. Every morning, it is a race against the clock to get ready and drop my baby off at daycare, so I have no time for complicated suit sets or expensive ones. Bizchic.com is well organized, so it's super easy to find the eact style you need, which led me to workleisure. It really made everything ao much easier! I can thow on my outift for the day without wortting about it being wrinkled. </p>

                     <p>&nbsp;I am an interior designer, and I like to be hands on with my work, but was not very sure how I would dress professionally to attract clients while also being more physically involved. Bizchic.com has been a great help, I figured out just what brands and styles that would accomodate my work. </p>

                    <hr>
                     <p>&nbsp;Bizchic.com turned out to be a necessity for me, though at first I thought the opposite. I am an up and coming fashion designer, and the fashion industry is super competetive and based on looks, how your clothes looks, how you look, everything. I stuggled to define my own professional style, not wanting anything bland or standard, but also not wanting to over power my designs, I needed something that stood out in a professional and serious way. I ended up studying everything on bizchic.com, sketching up designs of my own, and constructing my own professioanl wear. Since I have done this, my brand has started to gain some real traction! 10/10 would definitely reccomend to a friend. </p>

                     <p>&nbsp;Just like the title says, Confidence Confidence Confidence!! Man, bizchic.com has given me so much confidence. I've always been a quiet gay, I'm on the shorter side too, so I never really tried to dray attention to myself or dress up too fancy. It wasn't until after taking dressing tips from bizchic that I realized how I had been prohibiting my own success all this time. I have this new confidence now, and believe me all my friends cannot stop talkinhg about it. I have realized that a good set of professional wear can change how others preceive you.</p>

                     <p>&nbsp;This is pretty odd, but bizchic did wonders for my workplace. I manage a small group of sales personnel, and I know full well that outward appaeraneces are one of the most important aspects of selling a product. I sat my group down and we brainstorm how to create a cohesive and professional look for our sales group, and we found bizchic.com. The advice is pretty solid, and we are the best dressed salesmen in the city. </p>

I noticed a lack of design and originality in my designs and customers' requests, so I looked for inspiration online, finding bizchic.com. I have used many elements of the clothing examples on bizchic.com in my own work, and these new pieces have become customer favorites! I'm super glad I found bizchic.com!</p>

                     <p>&nbsp;i'm an executive invesor, and I've been on the business scene for a few decades now, so I am pretty familair with fashion expectations in my industry, but things have started to shift. The industry and clients of investment has gotten younger, and these younger executives and clients have such different fashion ideals. Old guys like myself are starting to look sloppy in a loose fitting suit pants, I'm worried we start to look less credited. To give myself a fighting chance, I decided to look toward the internet, of which I am not the most familiar and sought to avoid those who are insincere. Bizchic.com has been the most reliable. I didn't want to look as if i were trying to pass myself off as a millenial, but I wanted to modify my daily attire, maybe a slightly tighter paint, different colors, or new patterns. This site has really helped an older guy like myself stay up to speed on the lasted trends in business wear.</p>
